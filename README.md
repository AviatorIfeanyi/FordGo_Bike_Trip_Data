# Ford GoBike Trip Data
## by Kingsolomon Ifeanyichukwu


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual bike rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

> The peak hours of the bike service is usually during the morning when commuters are on their way to work and during the evening, when they are using the service to get back home.

> Subscribers are the most users of the bike service compared to users who registered as customers
> Male users are dominant in both types of users, signifying that men are the most people who patronize the service


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The age of users dont not in any way affect the duration of trips. One would expect that elderly persons will have short distance covered due to age, but as the scatter plot shows, there exists no relationship between age and duration of trips.
